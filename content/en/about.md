The project "*The Puzzle in a Mug*" is a relatively old project (about 10 years). I've already put it into practice a few times, but some life events delayed its development and changed its course.

Currently the project is about developing applications for data analysis, with the aim of *learn* and *share* some type of interesting knowledge to the community. In the future it could become something else, after all, the drink in the mug could run out or lose its taste at some point.

## Python Packages

Today the project has two ongoing projects already available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/). However, they are in the alpha phase of development, and should be used with caution.

### paramcheckup 

The ```paramcheckup``` package is just a collection of functions that check whether a value is of a specified type. It is being developed to be mainly used in ```class``` to check whether user inputs have the desired type. This solves a Python issue that the input types of ```class``` and ```function``` are just hints. Doing this check at the beginning of the code prevents computational costs.

When it finds something unexpected, the function returns a warning saying which parameter is wrong, why it is wrong and in which line of the user code the error occurred. It is also possible to show the complete error generated by the Python compiler.

To install the ```paramcheckup``` package use:

```python
pip install paramcheckup 
```

The documentation is available at [paramcheckup.readthedocs](https://paramcheckup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### normtest

The ```normtest``` package contains ```function``` and ```class``` to apply Normality tests to experimental data. Each test has its respective module and class, which can be accessed individually.

However, it is the ```class``` that should be used to obtain results in a simple and quick way: they return the main results, such as the test statistics, critical value, p-value (when available) and the conclusion of the test (e.g., Normal data or non-Normal data). They also allow access to graphical visualizations, such as graphs showing the expected distribution of the test.

There are currently three tests implemented, which are tests that make use of the correlation coefficient:

* Filliben;
* Looney-Gulledge;
* Ryan-Joiner;



PTo install the ```normtest``` package use:

```python
pip install normtest 
```

The documentation is available at [normtest.readthedocs](https://normtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


### Other packages

Other packages are under development and will be made available in the ~~not so~~ near future:

* ```pygnosis```: evaluates data regression;
* ```bibmaker```: creates ```.bib``` files;
* ```pysorption```: applies regression on adsorption data;

There are several other ideas, but I don't have the time ~~funding~~ at the moment.
